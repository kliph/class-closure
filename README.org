The charts are generated in two steps.  First the data are collected
from the git history by a shell script.  And then the data are
visualized by an HTML page with =chart.js=.

** Analysis
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ./scripts/analyze :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
  project_directory=~/projects/threadstreaks
  header="filename,last-commit,first-commit"

  git -C $project_directory ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD | awk '{ print $4 "," $3 }' > ./data/closures.csv

  filenames=$(cat ./data/closures.csv | awk -F "," '{ print $1 }')
  echo "$filenames" | xargs -L 1 git -C $project_directory log --follow --diff-filter=A --find-renames=40% -- | ag ^commit | awk '{ print $2 }' > ./data/first-commits

  echo "$({ echo "filenames,last-commit,first-commit" ; paste -d ',' ./data/closures.csv ./data/first-commits ; })" > ./data/closures.csv

#+END_SRC
